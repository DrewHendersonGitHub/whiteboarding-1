Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms - take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem - as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]


function sort(arr) {
  let check = true;
  while (check === true) {
    check = false;
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (arr[i - 1] > arr[i]) {
        let num = arr[i - 1];
        arr[i - 1] = arr[i];
        arr[i] = num;
        check = true;
      }
    }
  }
  return arr;
}

sort([10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1]);
